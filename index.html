    <h3>Meet the Dassanis!</h3>
    <p>Day 1: December 12th 2021. </p>
    <p>I wake up to a normal Sunday. I have my CRT lens, (new tech) where it corrects my cornea. I can already see much better. I brush my teeth and change into my normal clothes. I come downstairs, do my algebra homework and I eat a big breakfast. It consists half a smoothie, two eggs and four toasts with butter and pickles on the side. I go to my optmologist Dr. Young where he tested my vision. I then went to my best friend's house where we played flag football. My little sister canceled her big singing performance so we didn't have to deal with that. Our neighbor Bella babysat us. We played on our personal trampoline and we played Clue and had a drawing contest. We even played on our Vapor Pods and I beat them with my bicycle in races. We had pasta and went to bed. Before that I brushed my teeth got into my pijamas, put in my CRT lens on and went to bed at 7:00. </p>
